### Want to stay updated?  
~~[Click here to join the Redline Discord!](https://discord.gg/)~~  
Someone reported the Discord server and got it taken down. I'm working on setting up a new one, and will update this section when I'm finished.  

## Loadstring  
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xataxell/Redline/refs/heads/main/loader.lua'))()  
```
## What is Redline?  
Redline is a massive universal script based on many popular Minecraft hacked clients. It's customizable, easy to use, and packed with features.  

## Why use Redline?  
- **There's tons of options.** Every module has tons of configuration, giving you a completely unique and customizable experience.  
- **It's decently optimized.** Each module has mostly been designed to be super quick.  
- **It's built from scratch.** Everything you see in Redline was made from the ground up.  
- **It's secure.** Redline bypasses certain detections other scripts might not.  
- **It has too many features.** Most scripts just have aimbot, esp, and flight if you're lucky. Redline has everything.

When you execute it, press RightShift to open up the UI. Right click the menus to open up a list of modules under that category.

Make sure you pressed RightShift and there aren't any errors in console.
